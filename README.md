# Veteran Support Site (Starter)

This is a clean foundation for your veteran support website. 
Add your own background image (the flag with the text "STAND TALL, VETERAN YOU ARE NOT ALONE").

## How to use

1. Put your background image at: `assets/hero-flag.jpg` (replace the placeholder).
2. Open `index.html` in a browser to preview locally.
3. For GitHub Pages:
   - Create a new repo and upload everything in this zip to the root of the repo.
   - Commit & push.
   - In repo settings, enable GitHub Pages for the `main` branch (root).
   - Your site will be live at the Pages URL.

## Buttons
- Red button calls the Veterans Crisis Line: dials **988** (does *not* press 1 automatically).
- Black button opens SMS to **838255** (Veterans text line).

## Off‑canvas Menu
- Opens from the left via the ☰ button.
- "Click here to help support" text appears at the top (not yet clickable).
- "Settings" is pinned at the bottom with a Brightness slider that adjusts background brightness only.

## Files
- `index.html` – page markup
- `css/styles.css` – styles & layout
- `js/app.js` – menu + brightness logic
- `assets/hero-flag.jpg` – **add your image here** (filename must match)
- `assets/placeholder.png` – tiny placeholder used for the temp video poster
