# Stand With Veterans — Static Site

A lightweight, static landing page you can drop into GitHub.

## What’s included
- `index.html` — single-page layout (Hero, Mission, Focus Areas, Get Involved)
- `styles.css` — modern, accessible styling
- `script.js` — small JS for mobile menu + placeholder alerts
- `assets/hero-flag.svg` — decorative hero illustration
- `assets/favicon.svg` — simple star favicon

## Your previous constraints applied
- **No live chat**.
- **No external links yet** — buttons are labeled placeholders only.
- Removed extra sections and kept it focused/small for a first prototype.

## How to use (GitHub)
1. Create a repo (e.g., `veterans-site`) and upload all files.
2. (Optional) Enable GitHub Pages: Settings → Pages → Deploy from branch → `main` → `/root`.
3. Visit the Pages URL when it’s ready.

## Edit later
Swap placeholder copy, wire real links, add logos, and connect to your store when you’re ready.
